                In a digital realm, on Christmas Day's cheer<br>
                Amidst a chat, fate brought you near<br>
                Reshmi, a name that caught my eye<br>
                Our first encounter, a spark did fly<br>
                <br>
                Your wit and banter, sharp and bright<br>
                A friendship bloomed, a pure delight<br>
                Our birthmoons danced, a cosmic sign<br>
                In lunar harmony, your soul met mine<br>
                <br>
                Slowly, as time wove its intricate art<br>
                My heart found a path, a tender start<br>
                Feelings grew, emotions set free<br>
                Confessions whispered, "I've fallen for thee"<br>
                <br>
                "Let's know each other," you replied<br>
                A door left ajar, hearts open wide<br>
                Matching profiles, a subtle sign<br>
                Two souls converging, a love divine<br>
                <br>
                Now it’s been six months, feels like yesterday<br>
                Roasting each other in our own playful way<br>
                I promise, my love, to never leave you<br>
                Just like these months, my heart stays true<br>
                <br>
                With every moment, our bond grows strong<br>
                In the silent spaces where we belong<br>
                I promise to spend my lives with you<br>
                Forever and always, our love will renew<br>
                <br>
                In this digital world where our story began<br>
                Our journey unfolds, hand in hand<br>
                With hope as our guide and love as our tether<br>
                our journey will lead to forever, together<br>
